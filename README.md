An openVR driver with python and ESP32 with a MPU-6050 module.

# Running Python

To run python, simply use `python3 socket.py`

# Open VR Driver

I suggest you follow the tutorial made by FinallyFunctional, which can be found here:
[https://github.com/finallyfunctional/openvr-driver-example](https://github.com/finallyfunctional/openvr-driver-example)
For simplicity, I've added my changed files to `openvr-driver` folder so that you can use them as well.
All credits go to FinallyFunctional for such an amazing work!

# ESP32 Compiling & Running

Install ADAFruit MPU6050 driver in Arduino IDE.
Don't forget to put your wifi details and the ip from the machine that is running your python server, as well your VR games!
